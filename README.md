# DEVELOPMENT-OF-2-2-BIO-IMPEDANCE-SENSOR-ARRAY
This internship project focuses on the design and development of a 2Ã—2 bio-impedance sensor array for real-time and spatially resolved biological tissue monitoring. the work explores  integration of embedded electronics, analog signal processing, and digital communication to create a compact, low-power, and scalable bio-impedance measurement system
